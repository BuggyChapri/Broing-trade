    <h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>

    <p>
      Cryptocurrency is like money... but digital, fancy, and sprinkled with
      cryptographic magic. It operates on decentralized networks called
      blockchains, ensuring transparency and cutting out the middleman (yes, no
      more bank drama!).
    </p>
    <h3>Key Features:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Decentralized:</strong> It’s the wild west—no central authority,
        just peer-to-peer trading.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Secure:</strong> Encrypted and recorded on blockchains, so
        tampering is like Mission Impossible (Tom Cruise optional).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Global:</strong> Send and receive crypto across borders—goodbye,
        wire transfer fees!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Finite Supply:</strong> Limited like your patience for
        ads—scarcity can drive value up.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Volatile:</strong> Rollercoaster pricing—thrill seekers,
        rejoice!
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Side Project: Building a Crypto App</h2>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400" alt="App Development" />
    <p>
      In between analyzing the crypto market and listening to romantic tunes,
      I’m working on a sleek cryptocurrency app that simplifies trading for
      beginners. The app will have:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Real-time price tracking (because you need to know when Bitcoin moons).
      </li>
      <li>Secure wallets (to keep your precious coins safe).</li>
      <li>Fun features to learn and trade smarter.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Stay tuned for updates, or better yet, buy me coffee so I code faster.
      (Just kidding... unless?)
